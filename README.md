Best HTML Project Ideas For Beginners and Students

1. A tribute page
This is one of the most simple HTML website ideas you can make. As you can guess by the name, a tribute page shows respect for someone who inspires you, or someone you admire and revere. To make a tribute page, you only need to know fundamental HTML concepts.
First, you have to create a webpage. You can then add a picture of the person you are paying tribute to and add the personâ€™s details, achievements, and so on. If you wish, you can also write a few words of respect for him/her. Using CSS for this project will be beneficial as it will let you include different styles and layouts. Make sure to give the webpage an appealing background color (use earthy tones or pastel colors).

2. Essential for Web Development
HTML is the cornerstone of web development. It offers the structure and framework for web content. That means, when you develop a web page, you can use HTML to define the layout, headings, paragraphs, links, images, and many other things. Learning HTML is the first step towards becoming a web developer, as it forms the foundation for building more advanced skills in front-end and back-end development.
